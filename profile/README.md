We conduct multidisciplinary research, monitoring, and analysis of integrated environmental and living resource systems in coastal and offshore waters of the Pacific Ocean.

- Field research activities cover near-shore island ecosystems such as coral reefs to open ocean ecosystems on the high seas.
- Research focus includes: oceanography, coral reef ecosystem assessment and monitoring, benthic habitat mapping, and marine debris surveys and removal.
- Analysis of the current structure and dynamics of marine environments, as well as examination of potential projections of future conditions such as those resulting from climate change impacts are assessed with use of numerical ecosystem models.
- Because humans are a key part of the ecosystem, our research includes the social, cultural, and economic aspects of fishery and resource management decisions.
